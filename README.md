# Statistical Learning Course - CMU

This repository contains all of my assignments, lecture notes, and related materials from the Statistical Learning course I took as part of my graduate studies at Carnegie Mellon University. This course was designed as an introduction to fundamental concepts of probability and statistics, specifically for students outside of statistics and machine learning.

## Course Overview
The course covers the following key topics:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Parameter Estimation and Hypothesis Testing**
- **Clustering** (Unsupervised Learning)
- **Regression and Classification Models** (Supervised Learning)
- **ggplot2 for Data Visualization**
- **dplyr for Data Manipulation**
- **R Programming Basics**

All assignments and projects were completed using the R programming language.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes the following:

- **Assignments**: Solutions and analysis for the course assignments, demonstrating key concepts such as hypothesis testing, clustering, and regression models.
- **Lecture Notes**: Key takeaways from the lectures, which explain various statistical learning techniques and their applications.
- **R Scripts**: Code snippets used for data analysis, including EDA, regression, clustering, and visualization techniques with R packages like `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `tidyr`.

## Tools & Technologies

- **R Programming Language**
- **ggplot2**: For data visualization
- **dplyr**: For data manipulation
- **tidyr**: For data tidying
- **RStudio**: Integrated development environment for R
